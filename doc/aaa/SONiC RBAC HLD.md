# About this Manual
This document provides a high-level design approach for authentication and RBAC in the SONiC Management Framework.

For authentication, this document describes how the CLI and programmatic interfaces (REST, gNMI) -- collectively referred to in this document as the northbound interfaces (NBIs) -- will authenticate users and the supported credentials and methods.

For authorization, this document describes a centralized authorization approach to be implemented in the Translib component of the SONiC Management Framework.

# Scope
This document covers the interfaces and mechanisms by which NBIs will authenticate users who wish to access and configure the SONiC system via the Management Framework. It will also cover RBAC enforcement.

This document will NOT extensively cover (or assumes the pre-existence of):
- Implementation of remote authentication and authorization (RADIUS, TACACS+, etc.)
- Local user management: CLIs and APIs for creating local users on the system (TBD)
- Public Key Infrastructure management: X.509v3 certificate installation, deletion, trust store management, etc.

# 1 Feature Overview

## 1.1 Requirements

- The SONiC Management Framework must support authenticated access for the various supported northbound interfaces (NBIs): CLI, REST, and gNMI. Since the CLI works with the REST server, it must also be authenticated with the REST server.
- The NBIs must pass along the username info to Translib, so that Translib can enforce role-based access (RBAC).
- For RBAC, Linux Groups will facilitate authorization. Initially, two roles will be supported: read/write and read-only. Additionally, remotely-authenticated users who map to a defined role will be authenticated as a static global user on the system. These limitations should be revisited at a later date.


### 1.1.1 Functional Requirements

#### 1.1.1.1 NBI Authentication
A variety of authentication methods must be supported:
* **CLI** authentication is handled via the same mechanisms supported by SSH
  - Password-based Authentication
  - Public-key Authentication
* **REST** authentication
  - Password-based Authentication with Token-based authentication
  - Certificate-based Authentication
* **gNMI** Authentication
  - Password-based Authentication with Token-based authentication
  - Certificate-based Authentication
(**Question from Jeff**: When a user logs into the switch via SSH, will they be "dropped into" the KLISH shell? Can I make that assumption in this HLD?)

#### 1.1.1.2 CLI Authentication to REST server
Given that the CLI module works by issuing REST transactions to the Management Framework's REST server, the CLI module must also be able to authenticate with the REST server when REST authentication is enabled. This can be accomplished via several approaches:
1. **UNIX Socket** -- Since a user accessing the CLI has already been authenticated, the CLI module can communicate with the REST server via a UNIX socket. This UNIX socket is accessed as `root`, will not enforce any authentication methods, and is solely intended for use between CLI and REST server, so care must be taken to ensure that it is not remotely accessible by any indirect means. Additionally, the username of the CLI user must be shared between the CLI and the REST server, so that the REST server can further relay this information to Translib for RBAC enforcement. Note that this approach is still being researched, and (at first glance) a significant portion of custom code will need to be implemented.
2. **Self-Signed Certificates** -- As a user authenticates with SSH and is given access to the CLI shell, a script runs to generate a self-signed certificate associated with the user. Alternatively, the user's self-signed certificate may be generated when the user is "created" on the system. The user's information is embedded in the Subject field of the certificate, and then the certificate is installed in a static location (i.e., trust store). The CLI authenticates to the REST server with the same certificate, which is accepted because the REST server trusts all certificates installed in the static location. This approach is not as performant as the UNIX socket approach, but has the advantage of allowing the REST server to treat all incoming connections the same way, regardless of the client being a REST endpoint or the CLI module.

(TODO/DELL: Finalize on one of the above methods, then revise the document)

#### 1.1.1.3 Translib Enforcement of RBAC
The Translib module in the [management framework](https://github.com/project-arlo/SONiC/blob/master/doc/mgmt/Management%20Framework.md) is a central point for all commands, regardless of the interface (CLI, REST, gNMI). Therefore, the RBAC enforcement will be done in Translib library.

The CLI, REST, and gNMI will result in Translib calls with xpath and payload. Additionally, the REST and gNMI server modules must pass the username to the Translib. The RBAC checks will be enforced in the **Request Handler** of the Translib. The Request Handler processes the entire transaction atomically. Therefore, if even one operation in the transaction is not authorized, the entire transaction is rejected with the appropriate "Not authorized" error code. If the authorization succeeds, the transaction is passed to the Common Application module for further ‘transformation’ into the ABNF format. The rest of the flow of the transaction through the management framework is unmodified.
 
At bootup time of the manageability framework (or gNMI container), it is recommended to cache the [User DB](#326-user-db) if not already cached. This is because every command needs to access the information in the User DB in order to access the information. Alternately, instead of caching the entire User DB, the information can be cached once the record is read from the DB. Additionally, the Translib must listen to change notifications on the User DB in order to keep its cache current. 

As described in section [1.1.1.4 Linux Groups](#1114-linux-groups), the enforcement of the users and roles in Linux will be done via the Linux groups. A user can use linux commands on the linux shell and create users and linux groups (which represent the roles). This will mean that the information in the User DB is no longer current. In order to keep the information in the User DB and the linux /etc/passwd file in sync, Translib must register for notification for changes on /etc/passwd file. If there is no straighforwards way of doing so, then a function must be triggered on timer expiry to proactively read the /etc/passwd file and update the User DB. 
(TODO/Dell - Please update what is the approach followed).

Similarly, a user can be created either via CLI or REST. It is the responsibility of the Translib to ensure that when the user information is added to the User DB, the appropriate user and groups are also created in the /etc/passwd file. 
This way, the User DB information and the linux groups information is always in sync. 

Since Translib is the main authority on authorized operations, this means that the NBIs cannot render to the user what they are and are not allowed to do. The CLI, therefore, renders the entire command tree to a user, even the commands they are not authorized to execute.


#### 1.1.1.4 Linux Groups
RBAC will be facilitated via Linux Groups:
- Local users
  - Local user with `Operator` role is added into `docker` group
  - Local user with `Admin` role is added into `admin` group and is a `sudoer`.
- Remote users
  - Remote user with `Operator` role mapped to a global `remote-user` user who is part of `docker` group
  - Remote user with `Admin` role mapped to a global `remote-user-su` user who is part of `admin` group and is a `sudoer`
  - In the future, this "global user" approach will be revisited so that remote users are authenticated with their own username so that their activities may be properly audited.


### 1.1.2 Configuration and Management Requirements

Configuration and Management of authentication/RBAC will initially be limited to toggling authentication methods for the REST and gNMI NBIs.

No UI will be initially developed for user management. Initially, users must be managed via Linux tools like `useradd`, `usermod`, `passwd`, etc.



### 1.1.3 Scalability Requirements
Adding authentication to NBIs will result in some performance overhead, especially when doing operations involving asymmetric cryptography. Care should be taken to leverage performance-enhancing features of a protocol wherever possible.

#### 1.1.3.1 REST Server
- Persistent HTTP connections can be used to preserve TCP sessions, thereby avoiding handshake overhead.
- TLS session resumption can be used to preserve the TLS session layer, thereby avoiding TLS handshake overhead and repeated authentication operations (which can involve expensive asymmetric cryptographic operations)
- Token-based authentication can be used to preserve sessions for users who have already authenticated with password-based authentication, so that they do not need to constantly re-use their passwords.
(TODO/DELL: Finalize on the method for token-based auth. JWT is currently preferred.)

#### 1.1.3.2 gNMI Server
- TLS session resumption can be used to preserve the TLS session layer, thereby avoiding TLS handshake overhead and repeated authentication operations (which can involve expensive asymmetric cryptographic operations)

#### 1.1.3.3 Translib
(TODO/BRCM: Fill this out if applicable)

### 1.1.4 Warm Boot Requirements
N/A

## 1.2 Design Overview
### 1.2.1 Basic Approach
The code will extend the existing Klish (CLI) and REST Server modules in the sonic-mgmt-framework repository. Klish will be extended to enable authentication to the REST server (depending on the ultimately chosen approach), and the REST Server will need to be extended to pass username data to the Translib.

The Translib code (also in sonic-mgmt-framework) will be extended to support RBAC via Linux Groups. It will receive username data from the REST/gNMI NBIs and perform the Group lookup for a given user.

The gNMI server, which currently exists in the sonic-telemetry repository, needs to support passing the username down to Translib. It also needs to be extended to enable the 3 authentication methods, although they may just be enabled via configuration.


### 1.2.2 Container

### 1.2.3 SAI Overview
N/A

# 2 Functionality
## 2.1 Target Deployment Use Cases
Enterprise networks that enforce authentication for their management interfaces.

## 2.2 Functional Description
This feature enables authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) on the REST and gNMI programmatic interfaces that are provided by the SONiC Management Framework and Telemetry containers. With respect to authentication, these programmatic interfaces will support password-based authentication with tokens, and certificate-based authentication.

Since the Klish CLI in the management framework communicates with the REST server in the back-end, the solution will also be extended to support REST authentication.

RBAC will be enforced centrally in the management framework, so that users accessing the system through varying interfaces will be limited to the same, consistent set of operations and objects depending on their role. Users' roles will be mapped using Linux Groups.

Users and their groups will be managed via Linux tools and paradigms.

# 3 Design
## 3.1 Overview
(TODO/DELL: Draw a picture)

## 3.2 DB Changes
### 3.2.1 CONFIG DB
(TODO/DELL: Define ConfigDB changes. Mainly surrounding config of authentication methods for the REST/gNMI servers)

Note: Users will not initially be stored in the ConfigDB, so they won't be portable between systems.

N/A

### 3.2.3 STATE DB
N/A

### 3.2.4 ASIC DB
N/A

### 3.2.5 COUNTER DB
N/A

### 3.2.6 USER DB
A new DB will be introduced in Redis which maintains RBAC related tables in it. The User DB will have the following tables :
* **UserTable**
  
  This table contains the username to role mapping needed for enforcing the authorization checks.  It has the following columns :
    * *user* : This is the username being authorized. This is a string.
    * *tenant* : This contains the tenant with which the user is associated. This is a string
    * *role* : This specifies the role associated with the username in the tenant. This is a comma separated list of strings.
    The UserTable is keyed on <***user, tenant***>.

* **PrivilegeTable**
  
  This table has provides the information about the type of operations that a particular role is authorized to perform. The authorization can be performed at the granularity of a feature, feature group, or the entire system. The table has the following columns :
    * *role* : The role associated with the user that is being authorized. This is a string.
    * *feature* : This is feature that the role is being authorized to access. The granularity of the feature can be :
        * *feature* - A logical grouping of multiple commands. If the user is authorized to access a particular feature, the column contains the tag associated with that feature. (More on tagging later. This will be implemented in Phase 2 of RBAC.)
        * *feature-group* - A logical grouping of multiple features. If the user is authorized to a feature-group, the column contains the name of the feature-group. (More on feature-group later. This will be implemented in Phase 2 of RBAC.)
        * *entire-system* - If the user is being granted access to the entire system, the column contains *all*
    * *permissions* : Defines the permissions associated with the role. This is a string.
        * *none* - This is the default permissions that a role is created with. A role associated with *none* permission cannot access any resources on the system to read, or to modify them.
        * *read-only* - The role only has read access to the resources associated with the *feature*.
        * *read-write* - The role has permissions to read and write (create, modify and delete) the resources associated with the *feature*.
  The PrivilegeTable is keyed on <***role, feature***>
    
* **ResourceTable**
  (To be implemented in Phase 2)
  Though the resources are statically tagged with the features that they belong to, a ResourceTable is still needed so as to allow for future extensibility. It is possible that in the future, a customer wants a more granular control over the authorization and wants to either sub partition the features or override the default tagging associated with a feature. The ResourceTable will allow for this support in the future. In the Phase 2, this table will be create using the default tagging associated with the resources.
    * *resource* : The xpath associated with the resource being accessed. This is a string.
    * *feature-name* : The tag of the feature this resource belongs to.
  The ResourceTable is keyed on <***resource, feature***>

* **TenantTable**
  (To be implemented in Phase 3 or when Multi-tenancy is introduced)
  In most systems today, a single SONiC system will serve multiple tenants. A tenant is a group of users who have a different privileges for resource instances. As SONiC becomes multitenant, RBAC needs to account for this when authorizing users. The TenantTable is needed to enable this and has the following columns :
    * *resource* : The xpath associated with the resource being accessed. This is a string.
    * *tenant* : The tenant for which the resource partitioning is being done. This is a string.
    * *instances* : The instances of the *resource* allocated to this *tenant*. This is a list of instances.
  The TenantTable is keyed on <***resource, tenant***>

#### 3.6.2.3 Debug Commands
N/A

#### 3.6.2.4 IS-CLI Compliance
(TODO/DELL)

The following table maps SONIC CLI commands to corresponding IS-CLI commands. The compliance column identifies how the command comply to the IS-CLI syntax:

- **IS-CLI drop-in replace**  – meaning that it follows exactly the format of a pre-existing IS-CLI command.
- **IS-CLI-like**  – meaning that the exact format of the IS-CLI command could not be followed, but the command is similar to other commands for IS-CLI (e.g. IS-CLI may not offer the exact option, but the command can be positioned is a similar manner as others for the related feature).
- **SONIC** - meaning that no IS-CLI-like command could be found, so the command is derived specifically for SONIC.

|CLI Command|Compliance|IS-CLI Command (if applicable)| Link to the web site identifying the IS-CLI command (if applicable)|

**Deviations from IS-CLI:** If there is a deviation from IS-CLI, Please state the reason(s).

### 3.6.3 REST API Support
N/A -- Allowing REST authentication to be configured via the REST API itself will introduce additional test complexities and/or non-deterministic behavior.


# 4 Flow Diagrams
N/A

# 5 Error Handling
## 5.1 REST Server
The REST server should return standard HTTP errors when authentication fails or if the user tries to access a forbidden resource or perform an unauthorized activity.

## 5.2 gNMI server
The gNMI server should return standard gRPC errors when authentication fails. (Question: Does gRPC have "standard" errors for authorization failures?)

## 5.3 CLI
Authentication errors will be handled by SSH. However, the CLI must gracefully handle authorization failures from the REST server (the authorization failure would originate from Translib of course). While the CLI will render all of the available commands to a user, the user will actually only be able to execute a subset of them. This limitation is a result of the design decision to centralize RBAC in Translib. Nevertheless, the CLI must inform the user when they attempt to execute an unauthorized command.

## 5.4 Translib
(TODO/BRCM: Describe Translib RBAC error handling)

Question/ALL: What happens if a user authenticates but is not part of one of the pre-defined groups? Perhaps they should not be allowed to do anything at all?
Answer : Yes. It should not be allowed to do anything at all. Using this, we will be following an implicit deny-all approach in which a user is not given access to anything unless explicitly allowed.

# 6 Serviceability and Debug
All operations performed by NBIs (CLI commands, REST/gNMI operations) should be logged/audited with usernames attached to the given operation(s) performed.

Initially, users who are remotely authenticated will share a common role-specific username, so there will be a limitation here.
